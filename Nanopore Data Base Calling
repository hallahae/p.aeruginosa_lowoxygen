# Dorado basecaller v. 0.4.3 was used with parameters --modified-bases-models dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0_6mA@v3 for 6mA and dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0_5mCG_5hmCG@v3.1 for C5M and 5hmCG. 
#Super accuracy mode was used for basecalling, model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0

# Then, demultiplexed called reads were aligned on the reference genome using a Dorado aligner. 
# Mod_kit v. 0.2.0 was used to convert sorted bam files into bed files.
